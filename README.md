# PrivacyFirst Social

A privacy-first social media application that combines spontaneous photo sharing with WhatsApp's private group model. Built with React Native and Expo.

## Overview

PrivacyFirst Social is a unique social platform where:
- Random photos from your device are selected daily for sharing in private groups
- Users control whether to auto-publish or review within a 3-hour window
- All content is end-to-end encrypted and expires after 30 days
- No public feeds - only private group sharing
- Full user control over content (edit, delete, moderate)

## Key Features

### Privacy-First Design
- Client-side photo processing and selection
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- No public feeds or data harvesting
- 30-day automatic content deletion
- EXIF data stripping for privacy protection

### User Control
- Comprehensive onboarding with educational slides
- Choose between auto-publish or 3-hour review mode
- Edit captions and comments anytime
- Delete own photos instantly
- Moderate comments and reactions on your content

### Private Groups
- Create and manage private groups
- Instagram-style feeds with reactions and comments
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Group moderation tools

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- iOS Simulator (Mac only) or Android Emulator
- Expo Go app on your physical device (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quizgamesplayerslogo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your:
   - Supabase URL and API key
   - CloudFlare R2 credentials
   - Other configuration values

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run on your preferred platform**
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your device

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS simulator
- `npm run android` - Run on Android emulator
- `npm run web` - Run in web browser
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix linting issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Code Quality

This project uses:
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Husky** for git hooks
- **TypeScript** for static type checking

Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
- Lint and format staged files
- Run type checking
- Prevent commits with errors

## Database Setup

### Supabase Schema

The application requires the following database tables:

- `users` - User profiles and preferences
- `groups` - Private group information
- `group_members` - Group membership with roles
- `shares` - Shared photos and content
- `comments` - Comments on shares
- `reactions` - Emoji reactions
- `daily_selections` - Daily photo selection tracking
- `user_actions` - Audit trail for user actions

Refer to `/docs/database-schema.sql` for the complete schema.

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS policies to ensure:
- Users can only access their own data and group data
- Group members can only see content from their groups
- Proper authorization for all operations

## Architecture Highlights

### Client-Side Photo Processing
- Random photo selection happens entirely on the device
- Images are compressed and encrypted before upload
- EXIF metadata is stripped for privacy
- Multi-resolution generation for performance

### Real-Time Features
- WebSocket connections for instant updates
- Live feed updates when content is posted/deleted
- Real-time comment and reaction notifications
- Efficient cache invalidation

### Cost Optimization
- Aggressive caching at multiple levels (CDN, Redis, client)
- Tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)
- Image compression and WebP format
- Deduplication for identical images
- Automatic cleanup on deletion
